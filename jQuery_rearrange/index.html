			<div id="2">Strategy: your objectives and your users' objectives // Scope: what features/functionalities are included or not // Structure: site map // Skeleton: arrangement of elements // Surface: visual design</div>
			<div id="3">Earlier planes are more abstract, whereas later planes are more concrete and require finer attention to detail. Each plane is dependent on the plane before it and have a ripple effect. Decisions on upper planes can differ from the path determined by lower planes, and will thus cause a "reevaluation … of decisions on lower planes".</div>
